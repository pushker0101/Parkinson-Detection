# Parkinson-Detection
This folder includes the code to my project which aims to detect parkinson disease in a person using deep learning.
for detecting parkinsons 2 shapes were drawn by the patient circle and meander and then the image of the traced shape is uploaded on the model
then based on the trained data the model predicts whether the person is suffering from parkinsons or not by analying complex patterns of the shapes in the images.
the model with best accuracy came out to be CNN with accuracy of more than 95%.
The model is deployed on hugging face where you can go and test it out yourself.
the link to the deployed project is : https://huggingface.co/spaces/dr4g0n7ly/Parkinsons_Meander
You can refer to the images for sample or demo purpose
